== Background

GoSaleBot is a Telegram bot written in Go that facilitates peer-to-peer item sales through Telegram groups. Users interact with the bot to create a sale post, providing details such as title, description, price, location, and images. The bot acts as an intermediary between users and two Telegram groups: Group 1 for moderation and Group 2 for approved posts. The bot is deployed as a Docker container and uses SQLite for persistent storage.

== Requirements Overview

* Users submit sale posts via structured questions (title, description, price, location, images).
* Posts are sent to a configured moderation group (Group 1) and monitored for up to 24 hours.
* Moderation via reaction (‚úÖ = approve, reply = reject) with status updates and forwarding logic.
* Persistent storage of all post/group/message/user metadata and reliable time-based event processing.
* Configurable timeout duration and group IDs.
* Admin commands for querying and configuration (optional).

== Architecture Overview

The bot architecture consists of the following components:

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
actor User
actor Admin
participant "Telegram Bot (Go)" as Bot
database SQLite

User -> Bot : Start sale post
Bot -> User : Ask for details
User -> Bot : Provide details
Bot -> SQLite : Save draft post
Bot -> Group1 : Send post to moderation
Group1 -> Bot : ‚úÖ reaction
Bot -> SQLite : Mark post as approved
Bot -> Group1 : Delete post
Bot -> Group2 : Forward post
Group1 -> Bot : Reply
Bot -> SQLite : Mark post as rejected
Bot -> Group1 : Delete post
Bot -> User : Forward reply

== Data Model (SQLite)

```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    chat_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    message_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    status TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected')),
    title TEXT,
    description TEXT,
    price TEXT,
    location TEXT,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    expires_at DATETIME
);

CREATE TABLE photos (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    post_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES posts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    file_id TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE config (
    key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    value TEXT
);
```

== Message Handling Logic

The bot follows a finite state machine approach to collect post data step-by-step and transition post status:

. User Interaction Flow
* `/start` shows menu.
* Selecting "Sale Post" starts a wizard to ask:
** Title
** Description
** Price
** Location
** One or more Photos
* Once complete, a preview is sent to Group 1 with `status = 'pending'`.
* `expires_at = created_at + 24 hours`

. Moderation Handling
* ‚úÖ Reaction on the Group 1 message:
** Set `status = 'approved'`
** Forward the post (with photos) to Group 2
** Delete the original message from Group 1
* üó®Ô∏è Reply on the Group 1 message:
** Set `status = 'rejected'`
** Forward the reply to the user
** Delete the original message from Group 1

. Timeout Handling
* Background worker runs every N minutes (e.g., 5 min interval)
* SELECT all posts where:
** `status = 'pending'`
** `expires_at < NOW()`
* No action is taken (post remains), but system can expose this for admin review if needed

. Configuration
* Group 1 ID, Group 2 ID, and timeout duration (default 24h) are stored in the `config` table and read at startup

== Telegram Integration Details

* Uses the Telegram Bot API (long polling preferred for simplicity)
* Message IDs and file IDs are stored to allow editing/deleting/forwarding
* Uses inline keyboard buttons to confirm submission before posting to Group 1
* Optional: Admin-only commands to query active/pending posts or change group config

== Deployment

The bot is packaged as a Docker container and can be deployed on any cloud or VPS. Environment variables and configuration are managed via Docker Compose and SQLite.

== Extensibility

* The design supports additional admin commands, configurable timeouts, and persistent storage backends.
* The modular architecture allows for future enhancements, such as public marketplace browsing or payment integration (not in scope).
